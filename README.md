# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

Models the decay of 20,000 atoms over sufficient “time” to enable all atoms to decay to the final state. We alos calculate the number and energy generated from each of the four types of decay processes (a, b, R, Z) in this radioactive decay chain.
 
As alpha-particle decay is very harmful to humans, we can figure out how thick (cm) of a shield would be needed to safety block ALL a-particle decay energy, if each 1 cm blocks 2,200 MeV? (taking into account our average and standard deviation). In our case, ALL assumes that we block up to 3-sigma deviation of average energy
